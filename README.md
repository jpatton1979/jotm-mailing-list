# Jelly of the Month Mailing List

This project is an HTML form that subscribes someone to the Jelly of the Month club.  It accepts input from the user and adds the provided data to our system so they can start receiving a monthly newsletter along with a sample of that month's jelly.

<em> It really is the gift that keeps on giving! </em>

This was created for the Module 1 Week 2 lesson titled "Build Something of Your Choice!" for the Code:You WebDev pathway.  I chose this project to do some more work on CSS with some minor work on HTML and Javascript.
